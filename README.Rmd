This project describes a series of tools designed to improve academic productivity, understood as the number of research results obtained within a given time period.

## Best Practices: Collaborative Knowledge Networks

**Research best practices:** Actions and principles that ensure quality, efficiency, and ethics in research.

- **Collaborative knowledge networks**: Teams of researchers, resources, and technology that actively collaborate to share information, solve problems, and generate collective knowledge.

- **Collaboration culture:** Promoting communication between researchers and teams, facilitating access and information exchange, and encouraging the flow of knowledge and feedback during research.

![](README_figures/KnowledgeNetworks.jpg)

- **Collaborative documentation:** Record of progress, accessible to team members to use and provide feedback on relevant data and tools, speeding up workflows. 

   - **Clarity and reproducibility:** Makes it easier to understand and replicate the research process (Behind the final product: research, preparation, code, discussions, knowledge).
   -  **Avoids rework:** Recycling progress allows researchers to focus on analysis instead of repeated reviews. Even the author may have difficulty reproducing their own results when revisiting them.
   -  **Real-time feedback:** Like peer reviews, good documentation facilitates access to information and dynamic review of scripts, progress, and presentations by other researchers.
   -  **Researcher achievements:** Individual motivation and team participation optimize the use of human capital and promote the use of structural and relational capital.
   
- **Markdown to facilitate documentation:**
   - Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows formatting text with an easy-to-read syntax and converting it to other formats (e.g., HTML or PDF). 
   - .md files facilitate the structured writing of documentation and reproducibility of knowledge by linking calculation, output, and written analysis.
   
script example: 
```{r,  eval= T, echo=T, warning= F, message = F, attr.output='style="max-height: 10px;"'}
A<-1; B<-1
print("helloWorld")
A+B
```
   - GitHub automatically renders .md files in online repositories, showing the applied formatting (headings, lists, links, code, etc.), making versioned online reading and collaboration easier.
   
<span style="color: red;"> **This blog is an example of this! The invitation is for us to provide collaborative feedback so it stays updated and helps optimize processes among researchers.**<span style="color: red;">


## Collaborative Development

Knowledge-sharing and problem-solving networks where people ask questions, contribute, share ideas, solve challenges, and develop projects, fostering open collaboration and information sharing (a record is kept).

- **Task Search and Streamlining:**
  - Time spent searching: Looking for information, documentation, and help.
  - Streamlining repetitive tasks.
  - **Use of tools and platforms:** Facilitating discussions and knowledge exchange.

### Discussion and Collaboration Platforms

Researchers spend a significant amount of time searching the web for software-related tasks, such as:

-
   - Recycling information.
   - Consulting documentation.
   - Seeking help with code errors and their solution.
   - Asking questions or proposing ideas for discussion.
   - Sharing findings and getting community feedback.

- There is a need to optimize these repetitive tasks, allowing researchers to focus on more relevant priorities.

Collaborative platforms are tools that offer web environments to manage cloud content, facilitate discussions, exchange knowledge, and promote discussions among researchers of different expertise levels.

![Graphical representation of the main collaboration platforms. Some users actively participate while others are just observers or "lurkers".](README_figures/Colaborative_networks.jpg)

**Threaded discussion:** Hierarchical and navigable responses, with version control and collaborative knowledge.

-
  - Posting and debating: Posting questions, sharing knowledge, and debating various topics.
  - Quick access to knowledge: Providing access to peers' knowledge and experience.
  - Improved documentation: Suggestions and experiences to solve common problems.
  - Feedback: Discussion, optimization, and application in different contexts.
  - User guidance: Traceability and discussions available at any time.

Recycling experiences and processes helps improve productivity, as long as the context of proposed solutions and ongoing research is understood.

-
  - Although all research questions are different, many steps are common.
  - Reducing search effort.
  - Increasing individual knowledge (as long as it is contrasted with other peer-reviewed sources).
  - Exchange and collaboration: Promoting best practices and collaboration.
  - Community building: Facilitating connection and collaboration for research.

  - <span style="color: red;"> **This knowledge should be used to support research (e.g., networking, discussing hypotheses, guiding ideas, reusing codes, adapting algorithms, etc.), but it should always be analyzed based on a solid knowledge base of the researcher (knows theoretically what they are doing and why they are doing it).**<span style="color: red;">
  


#### Impact of AI on These Platforms
AI has transformed collaborative tools.

- **Improved Productivity through AI:**
   - Reduces search time.
   Provides real-time suggestions.
   Optimizes problem-solving.

- **Impact on Researcher:**
   - Enables continuous progress in activities.
   - Reduces search time and frustration, improving emotional well-being.
   - Encourages critical thinking through real-time feedback.
   - Increases focus and motivation for more meaningful tasks.

With the growth of AI, the use of collaborative tools has changed significantly:

- On the one hand, information on these platforms has been used to train AI models, improving the quality of automated responses.

![Common Crawl: Crawls all open access content on the internet, including both relevant content (e.g., peer-reviewed) and low-quality content.](README_figures/cc_table.jpg)

- On the other hand, public queries have decreased as many users now consult AI systems directly to answer questions without interacting with the platforms.

![](README_figures/QA_platforms.jpg)

- **The Dark Side of IA**
<span style="color: red;">This information from forums and AI must be used carefully! Both questions and training datasets for AI are generated from a diverse range of examples (not always correct). It's important to use these tools with judgment and context.<span style="color: red;">

   - Concerns about data privacy (e.g., surveillance, leaks).
   - User vulnerability: Responses (from moderators/developers) can influence users' perception, attitude, and behavior.
   
![](README_figures/darkSideAI.jpg)

   - Increasing dependence on tools to perform activities.
   - Reduction in human decision-making and creativity (decreased novelty).
   
![](README_figures/AI_novel.jpg)

APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) are sets of protocols that act as bridges allowing applications to communicate with each other. APIs enable service integration and task automation in research without needing to download large datasets, only the necessary ones.

- [IUCN](https://apiv3.iucnredlist.org/) ([rredlist](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rredlist/index.html)): Provides access to all data on species profiles from the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species (threat category, taxonomy, threats, geographic range).

- [GBIF](https://techdocs.gbif.org/en/openapi/) ([rgbif](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rgbif)): Offers access to the GBIF database for downloading records based on DarwinCore format info and spatial vectors.

- [STAC (Spatio Temporal Asset Catalogs)](https://stacspec.org/): Allows access and downloading of geospatial data catalogs within spatial and temporal study windows.
